So happy to be documenting this repo. This time, documentation will succeed!

The first copy is already a messed up one (ofcourse) of the framework that I've started, knowing that the first version will be unused, but just uploaded for historical reasons. Basically a good place to remember the messy programmer I used to be.


Todo on this:
I'm going to start doing things with xstate design, flexbox, datasets, css variable and perhaps sass.

But it will gradual. So the first step is flexbox :) but just desinging html templates with editor, then moving them to lo.js , which will be replaced by templates.js + JSONs & htmls of data for the templates. 

Making the next step in code evolution:
1) applying flexbox to design
2) using a hook mechanism 
3) toggling css classes to achieve changes to the UI
4) managing code architecture with xstate
5) finding out how dataset and css variable exactly apply.


But as far as the MVP I'm working on now concerns, only the first step - flexboxes - will be applied.
The rest I will hopfully implement as I go, while replacing old code.
